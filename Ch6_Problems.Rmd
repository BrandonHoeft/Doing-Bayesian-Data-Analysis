## Exercise 6.1 

This another exercise (similar to Ch. 5) to show that the posterior distribution from successive coin flips is invariant to the ordering of the data observed. 

### 6.1A A single coin flip

Start with a prior that expresses some uncertainty that a coin is fair: B($\theta$ | 4, 4). This beta distribution expresses a prior of a = 4 heads, b = 4 tails. You flip the coin once, returning heads. **what's the posterior distribution**?

A beta posterior distribution is of the form **B($\theta$ | z + a, N - z + b)** where:
  
* z: number of observed heads from the data
* N: total number of trials from the data
* a: shape parameter 1 of beta distribution (i.e. successes)
* b: shape parameter 2 of beta distribution (i.e. failures)
 
Using the `BernBeta` function associated with programs from the book, we get:

``` {r}
source("/Users/bhoeft/Desktop/temp/DBDA Programs/DBDA2E-utilities.R")
source("/Users/bhoeft/Desktop/temp/DBDA Programs/BernBeta.R")
# a = 4, b = 4 for beta prior; observe 1 head from 1 flip. 
BernBeta(priorBetaAB = c(4, 4), Data = c(1), showCentTend="Mode")
```

We see that the posterior distribution is of the form **B($\theta$ | 5, 4)**. Since we observed only 1 head, the posterior distribution only shifts a little to the right. The Posterior is a compromise between our prior beliefs and a single data point observed.

### Side Note: Calculate Beta Distribution with Base R

Our theta, beta prior, and beta posterior could all be derived using base R function `dbeta`.

``` {r eval = FALSE}
# create a sequence of possible values of parameter theta, our prior beliefs. 
theta <-  seq(0, 1, by = 0.1),
# calculate a PDF of our prior beliefs using the beta distribution. 
beta_prior <- dbeta(theta, shape1 = 4, shape2 = 4),
# Posterior distribution B(theta | z + a, N - z + b)
beta_posterior <- dbeta(theta, shape1 = 4 + 1, shape2 = 1 - 1 + 4)
```

### 6.1B Use posterior from the last flip as the new prior 

Here a = 5, and b = 4 as our beta distribution shape parameters. They account for the 1 heads in 1 trial observed in the prior experiment. On this next flip, we also get a head. What's our new posterior distribution?

``` {r}
# a = 5, b = 4 for beta prior; 1 for observing 1 heads
BernBeta(priorBetaAB = c(5, 4), Data = c(1), showCentTend="Mode")
```
We see that the posterior distribution is of the form **B($\theta$ | 6, 4)**.

### 6.1C Observe a tails on the 3rd flip.

Using the posterior from the last flip (accounts for 2 heads in 2 flips per the data), make a third coin flip, which returned tails. Now, what is the new posterior?

``` {r}
# a = 6, b = 4 for beta prior; 1 for observing 1 heads
BernBeta(priorBetaAB = c(6, 4), Data = c(0), showCentTend="Mode")
```

We see that the posterior distribution is of the form **B($\theta$ | 6, 5)**.

### 6.1D Change the order of the observed data

If you changed the order of the observed flips from **Head**, **Head**, **Tail** to **Tail**, **Head**, **Head** instead, would we get the same posterior distribution as observed in **6.1C**? Yes, because this analysis assumes  each observation is treated as an independent event. 

``` {r}
# Data observed previously is T, H. So B(theta | 1 + 4, 2 - 1 + 4) -> B(theta | 5, 5) is new prior
# toss a Head on final toss
BernBeta(priorBetaAB = c(5, 5), Data = c(1), showCentTend="Mode")
```

We get the same final posterior form as before regardless of ordering of the 3 coin tosses.  The posterior distribution is of the identical form **B($\theta$ | 6, 5)** from **6.1C**.

## Exercise 6.2 Election Polling

To connect high-density intervals to the real world. Suppose an election is coming up for Candidate A vs. B. *A recently published newspaper poll says that of 100 randomly sampled people, 58 preferred candidate A*. 

### 6.2A Read about some polling data

Suppose prior to reading the poll, your belief about who would win was **uniform**. What's your 95% HDI of your beliefs now having read the poll? A uniform beta distribution is of the form **B($\theta$ | 1, 1)**

``` {r}
prior_beliefs <- c(1, 1) # shape a and b parameters.
polling_observations <- c(rep(1, 58), rep(0, 100-58))
BernBeta(priorBetaAB = prior_beliefs,
         Data = polling_observations,
         showHDI = TRUE,
         showCentTend = "Mode")
```

### 6.2B Incorporate your own personal polling data

Say you conduct a follow up poll from the one you read about, and 57 of 100 people randomly sampled prefer candidate A. Now, what is the 95% highest density interval of your posterior beliefs that the general population prefers candidate A to B?

``` {r}
updated_prior_beliefs <- prior_beliefs + c(58, 100-58) # updated prior shape a and b parameters.
polling_observations2 <- c(rep(1, 57), rep(0, 100-57)) # my personal poll

BernBeta(priorBetaAB = updated_prior_beliefs,
         Data = polling_observations2,
         showHDI = TRUE,
         showCentTend = "Mode")
```

Given more data that resembles our updated previous beliefs, the posterior 95% HDI starts to get more concentrated or centered around $\theta$ = 0.58. 

## Exercise 6.3 Learning Experiment Biases

People have been thoroughly trained in a simple learning experiment:

* when they see two words, "radio" and "ocean", press F on keyboard
* when they see the two words, "radio" and "mountain", press J on the keyboard

New experiment with 50 people:

* when they see word "radio", instruct them to press F or J. 40 chose F, 10 chose J.
* when they see the words "ocean" and "mountain", press F or J. 15 chose F, 35 chose J.

Assuming a **uniform prior** belief, are people biased toward F or J for either of these test types? Use a 95% HDI to determine which biases can be claimed credible. 

``` {r}
prior_beliefs <- c(1, 1) # beta distribution shape a and b parameters
radio_experiment <- c(rep(1, 40), rep(0, 10)) # Response F is 1, response J is 0.
BernBeta(priorBetaAB = prior_beliefs,
         Data = radio_experiment,
         showHDI = TRUE,
         showCentTend = "Mode")

```

When we assess the computer keys pressed after hearing the word "radio", the 95% HDI of the posterior distribution goes from 0.68 to 0.89, way beyond $\theta$ = 0.5, which is the **region of practical equivalence (ROPE)** where we'd expect the bias towards F or J to be covered if people were truly not biased towards pressing either F or J key. We conclude that people have a bias towards F when they hear the word "radio" in this experiment.

``` {r}
prior_beliefs <- c(1, 1) # beta distribution shape a and b parameters
radio_experiment <- c(rep(1, 15), rep(0, 35)) # Response F is 1, response J is 0.
BernBeta(priorBetaAB = prior_beliefs,
         Data = radio_experiment,
         showHDI = TRUE,
         showCentTend = "Mode")

```

When we assess the computer keys pressed after hearing the word "ocean" and "mountain", the 95% HDI of the posterior distribution does not cover $\theta$ = 0.5. We can conclude that the participants have a bias against choosing F when hearing these two words together.

## Exercise 6.4 Coin from a Magic Trick Store

Suppose we have a coin from a magic trick store, and we believe this coin to be biased to usually come up heads or usually to come up tails, but we're unsure which. Express this uncertainty as a beta prior (either highly likely heads or tails). 

We flip the coin and oberve 4 heads in 5 flips. What is the posterior distribution that the coin is biased heads?

``` {r}
prior_beliefs <- c(0.1, 0.1) # shape a and b parameters
coin_flips <- c(1, 1, 1, 1, 0) # Heads is 1, tails is 0.
BernBeta(priorBetaAB = prior_beliefs,
         Data = coin_flips,
         showHDI = TRUE,
         showCentTend = "Mode")


```


## Exercise 6.5 Predicting the next observation

To get hands on experience with predicting the next dataum, and see how the prior influences that prediction.

### 6.5A Fair Coin

Suppose you know you have an untampered with, presumably fair coin, minted by the US Government. You have a strong prior belief the coin is fair. But upon flipping the coin 10 times, and observing 9 heads, you are not so sure. 

What's your predicted probability for the 11th flip, heads or tails? Justify the choice of a prior.

``` {r}
prior_beliefs <- c(250, 250)
coin_flips <- c(heads = rep(1, 9), tails = 0)
BernBeta(priorBetaAB = prior_beliefs,
         Data = coin_flips,
         showHDI = TRUE,
         showCentTend = "Mean")

```

My posterior belief that the coin is heads on the 11th flip is 0.51, the posterior mean (a weighted average of the prior mean and the data proportion). This is slightly higher than a fair coin. For calibrating my prior beliefs, I chose **B($\theta$ | 250, 250)**, which is a strong prior belief that the coin is fair. **The choice of a prior sample size of 500 coin flips reflects the sample size of new data that be able would to sway me from my prior beliefs, to equal weight between my priors and the data ** I would need to see at least 500 total flips, exhibiting 90% heads to really consider it an unbiased coin, given that I know it's an untampered with coin minted by the US Government. 

### 6.5B Magic Coin

Same setup as in 6.5A, except the coin I have is made of strange material and marked in fine print saying *Patent Pending, International Magic Inc.*. I observe 9 heads from 10 flips of this coin. 

What's the predicted probability for the 11th flip, heads or tails? Justify the choice of a prior.

``` {r}
prior_beliefs <- c(.05, .05)
coin_flips <- c(heads = rep(1, 9), tails = 0)
BernBeta(priorBetaAB = prior_beliefs,
         Data = coin_flips,
         showHDI = TRUE,
         showCentTend = "Mean")

```

I would initially start by thinking the coin is likely biased, but I'm unsure which way, biased heads or tails. I'll use a **B($\theta$ | .05, .05)** to express strong prior the coin is either very heads or very tails biased. My predicted probability for the 11th flip is .896 that the coin turns up heads. This probability reflects the posterior mean (a weighted average of the prior mean and the data proportion).
